<a id="what-is-athena" class="anchor" href="#what-is-athena" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>what is athena?</h2>

<p>Athena is an IRC bot written in C.
I used it to try and understand networking and processes in C.
There are two main parts to it: the web server and the IRC bot.
Feel free to poke around the code.
I have tried to add as many useful comments where I know what's going on.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>installation</h2>

<p><strong>athena only supports linux!</strong> I don't know if it can compile on other things (eg Windows/Mac OS), but you sure can try. I won't be able to help, though.</p>

<p>Try running <code>git clone https://github.com/ohnx/athena.git</code>, making config changes as necessary in athenabot.c, then running <code>gcc athenabot.c -o athenabot</code>.
If there are any errors, then please create an issue with the compilation error, or try to fix it yourself. I have included a few comments here and there that hopefully explain what thing do.</p>

<h2>
<a id="help" class="anchor" href="#help" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>help</h2>

<p>Run the command <code>help</code> if you want help. Try a command out if you don't know what it does, but for the most part, it shouldn't be too difficult to guess what a command does.</p>

<p>Naturally, admin commands can only be run by the owner (specified in the configuration at the top of the file).</p>
