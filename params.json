I won't be able to help, though.\r\n\r\nTry running ```git clone https://github.com/ohnx/athena.git```, making config changes as necessary in athenabot.c, then running ```gcc athenabot.c -o athenabot```.\r\nIf there are any errors, then please create an issue with the compilation error, or try to fix it yourself. I have included a few comments here and there that hopefully explain what thing do.\r\n## help\r\nRun the command ```help``` if you want help. Try a command out if you don't know what it does, but for the most part, it shouldn't be too difficult to guess what a command does.\r\n\r\nNaturally, admin commands can only be run by the owner (specified in the configuration at the top of the file).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
